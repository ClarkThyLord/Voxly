# About
Voxly, although still in its early stages, strives to be an all encompassing voxel-editor, by the community for the community, with a wide variety of features that are both powerful and intuitive to use. Voxly and it’s core, [Voxel-Core](https://github.com/ClarkThyLord/Voxel-Core), are made with [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), meaning two things: First, it has out of the box integration with Godot. Second, it’s designed with game development in mind, meaning it optimizes voxel content for games. Voxly also plans to offer tools for other engines and applications in the future.

# Getting Voxly
## Download / Clone
Since Voxly is still in its early stages, you’ll only be able to get it by downloading / cloning this repository and running it within Godot; in the future there will be more options to get Voxly.
